**Project: Tic Tac Toe**

*Simple implementation of The tictactoe game from The Odin Project curriculum.*

LIVE VERSION: https://antoniosimonetti.github.io/TicTacToeTOP/


The benefits I got:

- Learned how factory functions works and organizing better my code using the module pattern design.
- Improved my understanding on the scopes.


**Good things to look at:**

- The positive things that I bring with me from this project are mainly two, feeling confident about all the dom manipulation, and the second one is that finally
I fell this project is somehow responsive, even if at the same time I need still to improve about this.
